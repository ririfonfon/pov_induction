Bike POV display
===============
This is my version of a persistence-of-vision display attached on a bike. In my version I'm using a ESP8266 module for future WiFi integration.

This is not complete yet, and it's only 8-bits photos that works at the moment but that should be enough to display great images.

Below is thanks and license remarks from adafruit's software. A big thanks for your work.

Software related to DotStar LED persistence-of-vision performance items -- initially just the Trinket-based "Genesis Poi," but might devise more POV projects later...this is where they'll go.
